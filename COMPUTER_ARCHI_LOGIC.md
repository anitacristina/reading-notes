# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE AND LOGIC


# What Makes a Computer, a Computer?

Four main functions that makes a Computer a computer is Input, Storage, Processing , and Output.


# Binary and Data

In the Binary system, we only have two digits, zero and one. Computers use the binary system is because digital switches inside the computer can only be set to either on or off. Using these two digits we can count up to any number. For example, in the Binary system, number 9 can be written as 1 0 0 1. A bit is the smallest piece of information that a computer can store. 8  bits is called a byte, and a byte can store any number between 0 and 255. 32 bits can store from zero to over 4 billion numbers. Text, images, videos, and sound can also be represented using these binary numbers.

# Circuits and Logic

In the digital circuit, the signals exist in two states. On or OFF, TRUE or FALSE,  0 or 1.  Logic gates are the essential components of a digital circuit. These gates take two or more inputs and produce a single output. For example, the AND gate takes two binary inputs (00, 01, 10,11) and generates output (0,0,0 1). The basic logic gates are AND, OR, and NOT gates. In the circuit and logic video, the presenter explained how the NOT circuit works in detail. From this video, I understood that the computer could handle only 0s and 1s.
