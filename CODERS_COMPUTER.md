First, I installed the **Power Tools** required for the HTML Programming in my Mac Computer.  Below is the list of Power Tools I installed:

) **Git** - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-sourced distributed version control system similar to Tortoise SVN.

2) **Node** - Node is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)

4) **ESLint** - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool used to find and fix the problems in the JavaScript code quickly. This is similar to JSLint and JSHint, with a few exceptions.

5) **Tree** - A command in a Linux lists the files or directories in the given directory. Also, it returns the total number of files and directories listed.

6) **Ubuntu** - [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/ch01s01.html) is an open-source Linux operating system that is freely available for everyone. The word "ubuntu" means "humanity to others" and from the African Zulu language.
