# RESILIENCE


## Resilience:  
I was school second in my 10th-grade public exam and received many commendations from my teachers, friends, and neighbors and created more expectations from the 12th-grade public exam. I was overconfident myself and started to procrastinate my studies until the end of the exam date.  In the end, I did not get a good score (More than 95%) in my 12th-grade exam and lost admission to Medical colleges. Based on my 10th score, everyone thought that I would do very well in the 12th grade and be a doctor, but I did not. After the 12th results, I felt ashamed of my score, and I thought I lost everything in this world.  After facing such failure,  I should bounce back like a basketball instead of worrying and letting things keep me down. This self-learning resilience was helping me to teach and motivate my kids to be resilient. 

I remember the below quote from Shane Koyczan.
