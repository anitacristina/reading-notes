# POSITIVE THINKING


## Positive thinking: 

I feel positive thinking is my inherent skillset because even someone criticizes me, I would try to see the positive aspect instead of feeling about it. For example, few professors did not treat me equally when working as a lab administrator at the College. They used to scream in front of students even if I made any minor mistakes accidentally. I don't take those things seriously and try to correct myself and keep moving without repeating them in the future.  This attitude and my continuous learning skills helped me grow from lab admin to Lecturer in the same College within a Year and gained all my respect and became very close to the Professors who criticized me earlier.
