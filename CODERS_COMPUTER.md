## POWER TOOLS

First, I installed the **Power Tools** required for the HTML Programming in my Mac Computer.  Below is the list of Power Tools I installed:

1) **Git** - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-sourced distributed version control system similar to Tortoise SVN.

2) **Node** - Node is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)

3) **NPM** - NPM stands for Node Package Manager. NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and it is a default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/)

4) **ESLint** - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool used to find and fix the problems in the JavaScript code quickly. This is similar to JSLint and JSHint, with a few exceptions.

5) **Tree** - A command in a Linux lists the files or directories in the given directory. Also, it returns the total number of files and directories listed.

6) **Ubuntu** - [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/ch01s01.html) is an open-source Linux operating system that is freely available for everyone. The word "ubuntu" means "humanity to others" and from the African Zulu language.

7) **VS code** - Visual Studio Code [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode) is a cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS, Windows) editor that can be extended with plugins to meet our needs.


8) **Homebrew** - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open-source software management tool that helps users to install the required software on macOS (Apple’s operating system) and Linux in an easy way. With Homebrew, I need to type the following cmd in terminal to install the brew. "brew install <software_package>"


9) **Terminal** - The Mac Terminal is a command line system that can help users to quickly take control of the operating system and make changes as desired.


10) **Linux**- [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) is an open source Operating System. Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, we can find a “flavor” of Linux to match our needs. These versions are called distributions (or “distros”). The most popular Linux distributions are:
LINUX MINT, MANJARO, DEBIAN, **UBUNTU**, ANTERGOS, SOLUS, FEDORA, ELEMENTARY OS & OPENSUSE.
