## GROWTH MINDSET

I feel Growth Mindset is the fundamental to any learning. Hard work, Perseverance, Risk taking and Endurance not only leads to success academically, but also in our life.
I believe that the following **three reminders** would help me to grow my career without a limit.

### Positive thinking: 

I feel positive thinking is my inherent skillset because even someone criticizes me, I would try to see the positive aspect instead of feeling about it. For example, few professors did not treat me equally when working as a lab administrator at the College. They used to scream in front of students even if I made any minor mistakes accidentally. I don't take those things seriously and try to correct myself and keep moving without repeating them in the future.  This attitude and my continuous learning skills helped me grow from lab admin to Lecturer in the same College within a Year and gained all my respect and became very close to the Professors who criticized me earlier.

### Resilience:  
I was school second in my 10th-grade public exam and received many commendations from my teachers, friends, and neighbors and created more expectations from the 12th-grade public exam. I was overconfident myself and started to procrastinate my studies until the end of the exam date.  In the end, I did not get a good score (More than 95%) in my 12th-grade exam and lost admission to Medical colleges. Based on my 10th score, everyone thought that I would do very well in the 12th grade and be a doctor, but I did not. After the 12th results, I felt ashamed of my score, and I thought I lost everything in this world.  After facing such failure,  I should bounce back like a basketball instead of worrying and letting things keep me down. This self-learning resilience was helping me to teach and motivate my kids to be resilient. 

I remember the below quote from Shane Koyczan.

>If your heart is broken, make art with the pieces



### Continuous Learning:   

Based on my experience, I realized that continuous learning is the biggest asset to create a successful career. That is the reason I joined the DeltaV School. 
This will also help me stay on course, develop humbleness, and face the challenges with self-confidence. There are many updates and versions to keep the software safe, secure, and reliable. Likewise, continuous learning is a tool to keep my skills fresh, active, and sustained growth.
