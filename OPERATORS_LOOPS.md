# OPERATORS AND LOOPS
## COMPARISON and LOGICAL OPERATORS
### CHAPTER 4 - Pages 150-151,156 and 157

### Logical Operators
The logic operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Operator | Description | Example
---------|-------------|-----------
&&       |   AND       |  (x>5 && y<10) is true
!        |   NOT       |  !(x==y) is true
`||` | OR|
 


Below table lists the comparisaon operators and examples

Operators| Description| Examples           
------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- 
Equal (==)|Returns true if the operands are equal|var1 == 3; var1 == "3"       
Not equal (!=)|Returns true if the operands are not equal|var1 != 3; var2 != "3"
Strict equal (===)|	Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type| var === 3 
Strict not equal (!==)|Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type|var1 !== "3; 3 !== '3'
Greater than (>) |Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand|var2 > var1 ;"12" > 2
Greater than or equal (>=)	|Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand|var2 >= var1; var1 >= 3
Less than (<)	|Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand |var1 < var2; "2" < 12
Less than or equal (<=)	|Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand|var1 <= var2; var2 <= 5

### CHAPTER 4 -P ages 170-173 and 176
If we want to run a set of code several times, then the loop concept comes in handy. The different kinds of Loops are: For, while, and do-while.

### For Loop
For Loop - This loops through a block of code several times. 
```Syntax:```
```for ( initialization; condition evaluation; increment)```
```{```
```// code block```
```}```

### While Loop
As long as the condition is true the ```while``` loop loops through a block of code.

```Syntax:```
```while (condition)```
```{```
```// code block```
```}```

### Do-While
The do-while is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code once before checking the condition. Once the condition becomes true, it will run the code until the condition fails.

```Syntax:```
```do```
```{```
``` // code block```
```}```
```while (i<10);```
