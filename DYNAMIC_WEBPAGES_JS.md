# DYNAMIC WEBPAGES WITH JAVASCRIPT


## CHAPTER 1/C - How Do I write a script for a WebPage

**JavaScript** is a scripting language to update and change both HTML and CSS. JavaScript can calculate, manipulate, and validate data on HTML pages. In Web development, Javascript can be used for changing the HTML content, HTML attribute values and HTML styles (CSS). Also, JS can be used for Hiding and Showing the  HTML elements.

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between ```<script> and </script>``` tags.  JavaScripts are placed in the ```<body>```, or in the ```<head>``` section of an HTML page, or both. JavaScript runs where it is found in the HTML. The ```<script>``` in the HTML pages tells the browser to load the Javascript file which is similar to the <link> element used to load a CSS file.  JavaScript can "display" data in 4 different ways: **innerHTML**, **document.write()**, **window.alert()** and **console.log()**


## CHAPTER 2 - Basic Javascript Instructions (Pages 53-68 from Duckett) 

**Statement** is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as statement. Statements should end with semicolon ```;```. **Comments** inside the Javascript are important because this helps me to understand tne read the code easier.  Two forward slash ```//```
is used for **single-line** comment and ```/*   */``` is used for **multi-line** comment.

JavaScript **Variables** are containers for storing data values. Variables can be declared using the keyword called ```var```. We can also assign a value to the variable ```var quantity = 3;```. JavaScript **variables** can hold data types such as  Numeric, Strings and Boolean. Once the value is assigned to the variable, we can change the value of the variable in the same script.
