I taught undergraduate and graduate students during my stay at Loyola College. After marriage, I move to another state where I worked as a Computer Science teacher at [Presidency Group of Institutions](https://www.presidencyschools.org/), Bangalore, India.  I was entirely responsible for the computer science department to develop the syllabus and conduct exams for all high school students.

In my free time, I  volunteer for 4H, Explora Vision Science Fair, and Lego League.
