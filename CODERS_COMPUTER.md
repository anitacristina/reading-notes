## POWER TOOLS

First, I installed the **Power Tools** required for the HTML Programming in my Mac Computer.  Below is the list of Power Tools I installed:
1) **Git** - Git is a free and open sourced distributed version control system similar to Tortorise SVN.
2) **Node** - Node is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)
3) **NPM** - NPM stands for Node Package Manager. NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and it is a default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/)
4) **ESLint** - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool used to quickly find and fix the problems in the JavaScript code. This is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions.
5) **Tree** - It is command in a Linux that lists the files or directories in the given directory. Also, it returns the total number of files and directories listed.
6) **Ubuntu**
7) **VS code**
8) **Homebrew**
