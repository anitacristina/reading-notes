# Revisions and the Cloud

**Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history

**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that helps you to manage Git repositories.

**Repository** is a collection of files that we have told Git to pay attention to

        Usually, one project is equal to one repository
