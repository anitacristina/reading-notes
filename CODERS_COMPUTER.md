## POWER TOOLS

First, I installed the **Power Tools** required for the HTML Programming in my Mac Computer.  Below is the list of Power Tools I installed:

1) **Git** - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-sourced distributed version control system similar to Tortoise SVN.

2) **Node** - Node is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://v8.dev/)

3) **NPM** - NPM stands for Node Package Manager. NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and it is a default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/)

4) **ESLint** - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool used to find and fix the problems in the JavaScript code quickly. This is similar to JSLint and JSHint, with a few exceptions.

5) **Tree** - A command in a Linux lists the files or directories in the given directory. Also, it returns the total number of files and directories listed.

6) **Ubuntu** - [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/s390x/ch01s01.html) is an open-source Linux operating system that is freely available for everyone. The word "ubuntu" means "humanity to others" and from the African Zulu language.

7) **VS code** - Visual Studio Code [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode) is a cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS, Windows) editor that can be extended with plugins to meet our needs.


8) **Homebrew** - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an open-source software management tool that helps users to install the required software on macOS (Apple’s operating system) and Linux in an easy way. With Homebrew, I need to type the following cmd in terminal to install the brew. "brew install <software_package>"


9) **Terminal** - The Mac Terminal is a command line system that can help users to quickly take control of the operating system and make changes as desired.


10) **Linux**- [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/) is an open source Operating System. Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, we can find a “flavor” of Linux to match our needs. These versions are called distributions (or “distros”). The most popular Linux distributions are:
LINUX MINT, MANJARO, DEBIAN, **UBUNTU**, ANTERGOS, SOLUS, FEDORA, ELEMENTARY OS & OPENSUSE.


## Text Editors

A text editor is a piece of software used for editing plain text files. Below table mentions the Text Editors and its Usage

**Text Editor**| **Windows** | **Mac OS**| **Linux** | **Features**
------------ | ------------- | ---------- | -----------
**Notepad++**	            |	  YES  | NO       |NO |Syntax Highlight, Code, word & function Completion
**BB Edit**  |   NO  	| YES       | NO |Code Folding, Syntax coloring, optional line and cursor position display
**VS code**     |  YES      |   YES   |YES|  Syntax Highlight, themes, extensions and Code Completion       
**Atom**  |	 YES    |  YES    |  YES |  Syntax Highlight, themes and extensions      
**Brackets**	 | YES   		  |   YES  |   YES | Supports only HTML, CSS and JavaScript     
**Sublime Text**| YES        |YES     |   YES | Syntax Highlighting, Code Completion, themes and extensions

**UltraEdit**|  YES          |  YES   |    YES |  Syntax Highlight, themes, extensions and Code Completion     

Out of these Text Editor, I prefer VScode and UltraEdit.

## Linux Tutorial

### 1) The Command Line
**Shell** A Unix Shell is both a Command interpreter and a Programming Language.
**Bash**  Bash is the Shell or Command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. Bash stands for **"Bourne-Again Shell"**

### 2) Basic Navigation Commands

**pwd** - Print Working Directory ->  where are we currently?

**ls[path]** - List -> Perform a listing of a the given path or the current directory. Common options: -l , -h, -a

**cd[path]** - Change Directories -> move from one directory to another dicectory

**Absolute Path** - One beginning from the root of the file system ( eg. /users/anitacristina)

**Relative Path** - One relative to where you currently are in the system (eg. Documents/Deltav)

**~(tilde)** - Used in paths as a reference to the home directory (eg. ~/Documents)

**.(dot)** - Used in paths as a reference to the current directory.

**..(dot dot)** - Used in paths as a refernce to the current directories parent directory

**TAB Completion** - Start typing and Press TAB. The system will auto complete the path.


### 3) More About Files

**file[path]** - Find out what type of a item a file or directory is

**Spaces in names** - Put whole path in quotes (") or a backslash (\) in front of spaces.

**Hidden files and Directories** - A name beginning with a . (dot) is considered hidden
