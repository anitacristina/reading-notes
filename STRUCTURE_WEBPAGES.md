## Introduction to HTML
This HTML page was written using the Vscode tool and used Git commands such as Add, Commit and push to update the code from my local machine to github server.

In this page  I discuss about Chapter 1, 17 and 18 from the book "HTML & CSS" by **Duckett**

### CHAPTER 1 - STRUCTURE

#### HTML Intro:

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language that can be used for creating Stunning Web pages.HTML consists of a series of elements and the elements tells the browser how to display the content.

#### HTML Element:

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.Or It can also be defined by a start tag,some content and an end tag

The end tag has an extra forward slash in it

<tagname> Content </tagname>

Start Tag|Element|End Tag
---------|--------|---------
<h1>|Heading 1|</h1>
<p>|Paragraph|</p>
<br>|None|None

Some HTML elements have no content like the <br> element.These are called empty elements.<br> tag defines a line break and has no end tag

#### Attributes:

HTML attributes provides additional information about the content of HTML elements.And attributes are always specified in the opening tag.

Example 1:

<a href="https://WWW.google.com">Google</a>

Here <a> tag defines Hyperlink and "**href**" attribute specifies the URL

Example 2:

<img src="image1.jpg "width="500" height ="500">

Here <img> tag embeds an image and **src** attribute specifies the path ,**width** and **height** attributes specifies the width and height of the image.

### CHAPTER 17 -HTML5 Layout

In this chapter,I learned about difference between traditional HTML Layout Versus New HTML Layout.The structure between the traditional and new HTML remains the same.But many of the div elements have been replaced by new layout element such as header,nav,article,aside,section and footer. 

Using the HTML5 Layout, I created my new webpage called [Anita's Kitchen](https://anitacristina.github.io/HTML-Learning-Journal)

### CHAPTER 18 - Process and Design

This chapter allows me to understand the complete process of web design in detail. Before implementing the code, the web design can be achieved using the wireframe. A wireframe is a simple sketch of the critical information that needs to go on each site page. The wireframe is like a blueprint for a house. The wireframe should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds, or images for the website.  We can also differentiate the information on the page using size, color, and style to get the website's data quickly.
